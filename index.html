            <p>I am proud to call myself an official "Austinite". I've called the Greater Austin Area my official home for the last 29 years. I love to travel but somehow always find myself back in Central Texas. It's been both exciting and bitter sweet to watch how much Austin, TX has grown over the years. </p>
            <p>After graduating from the University of Texas with a Government degree, I decided to stay in Austin and have worked for The University ever since. I currently manage a talented team of electro-mechanical technicians who support a group of nearly 40 engineers performing sonar defense research for the US Navy. Some days feel more glamorous than others, but everyday brings something new to learn.</p>
            <p>Currently, I live in North West Austin with my husband and 2-year-old son. We enjoy hiking, spending time with friends, checking out the great food Austin has to offer, and catching all the naps we can get!</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my page, I hope you enjoy the rest of the content!</p>
